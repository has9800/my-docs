# Welcome to My-Docs

This is a documentation project where I'm collecting my knowledge about all aspects computer science and software engineering as a whole. This documentation serves as a single source for all my notes so I could come back to refresh my mind on a certain topic.

I could just refer to official documentation but I find that consuming something I learnt and translating it into my own wording helps solidify my understanding, and official documentation can be really hard to follow sometimes ðŸ’€

This is a living project and will be constantly updated. Think of it as my digital notebook ðŸ“š.

I also try my best to explain compex topics in wording that others can easily absorb so someone else might be able to benefit from my notes. The majority of the pages have a list of topics I'll write about currently.

I'll also leave GitHub links on each page just incase I explain a topic wrong and someone could correct me, or if it's even a simple spelling mistake. Pull requests are welcome ðŸ™‚
